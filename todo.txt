* Add playable backend for debugging
  * Make some game
    * google chrome dinosaur jump? << boring
    * super meat bot again? << nah
    * mini-spelunky? << discrete inputs, but requires a lot of content (and probably a lot of training too)
    * asteroids! << think this is best, simplest game but starts me working with keras earliest
      * can be extended with buddies, ATC and communication (possibly enemies too?)
    * bowmaster?
    * gunmaster? super crate box (single weapon)? << super crate box would be cool, discrete input, high skill ceiling (just shove more dudes in there)
    * hammerwatch survival?
    * steambirds survival? continuous action space, not great for first attempt
    * some sort of 3D platformer? Prince of persia? Titanfall movement only? very complex, continuous
    * car driver? kinda nice
* Add keras backend for training
* Add standalone trainer for training, emitting checkpoints/models
* Add program to fork off a trainer and periodically show the latest training result, like my super meat bot implementation
  * Add training performance graph (training data and test)

asteroids implementation
+ background
- game model/game representation split design
  * do all the gameplay and rendering together, but make sure they're separable
- player input abstraction (keyboard vs ML input)
- player movement
- player shooting
- asteroid movement
- asteroid player collision
- asteroid bullet collision
- end of level asteroid respawn
- add scoring

ML implementation
- abstract asteroids as a gym
- implement observation space
- implement a 2 layer NN agent and begin online training
- save models from the online training
- implement online model loading and run the trained models in evaluation mode
- implement offline training and save models
- implement trainer fork and multiprocess communication to receive a model from the training process, show in real time
- add training stats communication from the training process, show in graph form next to the gameplay

Further work
- iterate on agent architecture (4 layer NN? Wide NN?)
- Add second player (allow online play with a human player and an ML NPC)
- Deploy probes to get more inputs to the ML agent?
- Add ML agent who can see the whole of the map and one that cannot, see how they work together?
  - air traffic control style agent who communicates with the fighter?
